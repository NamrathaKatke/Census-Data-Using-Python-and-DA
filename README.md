# Census-Data-Using-Python-and-DA
This project uses Python to analyze and visualize census data. By applying Pandas and Matplotlib, it cleans and explores demographic information, revealing trends in population distribution, age, and socioeconomic factors. The insights aid in policy planning and resource allocation decisions.
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of census data using Python. The goal is to leverage Python's data manipulation and analysis libraries to gain insights from census data and present the findings in an accessible format.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data visualization
Statistical analysis and modeling
Reporting and documentation of findings
